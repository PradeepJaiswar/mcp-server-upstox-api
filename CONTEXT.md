https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/open-api/

## Core Functionality
- To interact with Upstox API https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/open-api/ via MCP protocol  
- Upstox API sample code are present at:  
  https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/example-code/introduction  
- For Upstox API sample code reference use curl request in the example page:  
  https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/example-code/introduction  
- All the Upstox API interaction requires Access token. Access token is read and used from 

## Usage
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start

## Technical Requirements
- Code should be modular
- Separate file for each mcp command needed
- Code comments should be detailed and professional
